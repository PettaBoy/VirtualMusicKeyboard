Version 1.0.1 (14-09-2021)
-------------

Additions:

* Added the About and Help buttons. Now you can refer to the help file easily.
* Added a blank box to separate the generic and metronome settings. This box will be used to display music sheet notations in
  future versions.

Important Note: We have migrated the setup files for VirtualMusicKeyboard and the README from its now-deleted Download page to the Releases section of the repo page.
Please remove any bookmark of the Download page if you have any.
